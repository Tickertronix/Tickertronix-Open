CircuitPython libraries used by `matrix-portal-single`.

This repository vendors the required CircuitPython `.mpy` libraries under `lib/` so you can copy the
entire `matrix-portal-single/` folder onto the `CIRCUITPY` drive and run without installing the
library bundle separately.

If you need to refresh these dependencies, replace the contents of this folder with the matching
version from the Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle: https://circuitpython.org/libraries
